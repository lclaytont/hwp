### **Create a Portfolio Website**

As a developer, it is important to have a place to refer people to in order to view your contact information as well as some of the current and past projects you are either working on or have worked on. Building a portfolio website is a good way for you to get some practice with HTML, CSS, and even some Bootstrap. It's important to remember this is the website that future employers will be looking at to get a snapshot at your professional background and your code.  

### **Your portfolio website should have the following information:**
* A profile image of yourself  
* A short bio of yourself  
* Social and contact links (LinkedIn, Github, Email)
* Projects (There must a way to link out to your projects whether they are live or on Github)  


### **Phase 1**
* Create a portfolio with basic styling
* Use Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/ (tip: use Bootstrap CDN)
* Present your website in class

**See the `phase_1_tutorial` folder for instructions.**
