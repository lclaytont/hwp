### **Phase 1**
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your very own website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In part 1 of this tutorial, we will build the site with just HTML. It won't be pretty, but it will work. In part 2, we will refactor our site by adding CSS to improve the appearance and layout. In part 3, we will demonstrate how the Bootstrap framework allows us to quickly build an awesome responsive site.

Throughout this example, we will build a portfolio website. The site requirements are as follows:
• A profile image of yourself  
• A short bio of yourself  
• Social links (LinkedIn, Github, Twitter)  
• Your contact information (name, email, and phone number)  
• Projects (There must a way to link out to your projects whether they are live or on Github)   

#### Part 1 - HTML

In your projects folder, create a new folder: `$ mkdir portfolio_site`

#### **Example Template**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!-- Update your website title -->
    <title>My Website</title>

    <!-- Load Bootstrap CSS here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->

    <!-- At the end of all your content, add Bootstrap JS here -->
  </body>
</html>
```
