## Scoring Rubric

### Formatting and Code Clarity

| Points | Why
| ------ | ---
| 5 | Code is formatted using proper indentation and white space. Appropriate and expressive naming conventions are used. Comments are used to explain tricky logic, when necessary. Any developer could jump straight into this code and know what's going on. |
| 4 | Code is mostly formatted using proper indentation and white space. Naming conventions are generally expressive. Comments are mostly used to explain tricky logic, when necessary. |
| 3 | Code makes an effort to use proper indentation and white space, but may have a few areas formatted improperly. Naming conventions may not be the most expressive, and parts of the code may be difficult to understand. |
| 2 | Parts of your code use proper indentation and whitespace, as well as expressive naming conventions. Large areas of your code, though, are ambiguous or formatted improperly. |
| 1 | Your code exists, and that's the most that can be said for it. Actually, it may not even exist. Take a long, hard look at some Ruby style guides. |

### Meets Project Requirements

| Points | Why
| ------ | ---
| 5 | All the project requirements were met, and you've clearly pushed yourself to get the most out of this learning experience by exploring new methods and techniques. |
| 4 | All the project requirements were met satisfactorily. |
| 3 | Most of the project requirements were met, but you may have missed a point of two. |
| 2 |Some of the project requirements were met. The project may have been turned in late. |
| 1 | There is nothing but cobwebs inside your program. Your project was turned in late, likely a few years late. |

### DRYness

| Points | Why
| ------ | ---
| 5 | Your code is so DRY it's starting to get flaky skin. And that's exactly what you wanted! |
| 4 | You've made a solid effort refactoring repeated code. Most of the code doesn't repeat itself, though there may still be some parts worth taking another look at. |
| 3 | You're definitely aware of the concept of DRYness, and that's a great start. There are major parts of your code that could benefit from a refactor, but hey! Done is better than perfect, after all. |
| 2 | An effort to refactor repeated code has been made, but it may not have been executed successfully. |
| 1 | Your code is so wet it makes Seattle look dry. |
